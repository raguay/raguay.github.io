      <description>Well, all the project pages have been moved over to this new site. Now, I need time to add to it as not all of my projects are currently listed.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about moving over my tutorials as they were never overly popular. But, I most likely will move over the ones that I personally like. If there is one you would like to make sure is moved over, just let me know.</description>
