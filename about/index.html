<h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2>

<p>Custom Computer Tools is a website owned and ran by Richard Guay, missionary in Thailand. Before I trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ to save me from my sins, I was an Electrical Engineer and Programmer by trade. You can read my <a href="http://www.tenforthais.org/richard-testimony">testimony of salvation</a> and my <a href="http://www.tenforthais.org/richard-resume">resume</a>. I still love to program and have kept up with the times somewhat.</p>

<p>Since then, the hard economic times and various reasons, our support is no longer sufficient for all of our medical and educational needs. Since I have a skill, I felt led of God to do as Paul did in supplying his needs through his skills to help when others are not able (Acts 20:34 &ldquo;Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.&rdquo;). The result is this website.</p>

<p>All the computer tools found here I have found useful in the construction and maintenance of several websites. I hope you too find them useful.</p>

<h2 id="tutorials-written-on-other-sites">Tutorials Written on Other Sites</h2>

<p>I also write tutorials for <a href="http://computers.tutsplus.com">Computer Tuts+</a>. I try to mention the articles in the areas that I already have similar topics on this site (ie. Alfred articles are listed on my <a href="http://customct.com/alfred">Alfred Workflows page</a>). Here are articles that do not go along with other themes:</p>
