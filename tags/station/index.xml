      <description>It is hard keeping up with all the tabs in Chrome or FireFox. On an average day, I&amp;rsquo;ll have anywhere from 10 to 30 tabs open at once. Not only is it hard to find the right tab, but my system starts to slow down and sputter with the high memory usage. Therefore, I open and close many tabs to a particular website over and over.
But, I just recently found a new friend that helps with this problem.</description>
