      <description>I love zsh and ohmyzsh for my command line. It looks great and is very flexible. But, I recently added zplug as well with several great plugins. I would recommend using it. But, you might want to watch out for the &amp;ldquo;gotcha&amp;rdquo; that I ran into.
The zplug command runs several checks and loads several scripts each time you load a zsh instance. This does increase the startup time, but I figured that wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of an issue since I load several instances when I boot the system.</description>
