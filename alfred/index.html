        <p>Alfred is a great companion working on the Mac. It helps me in all of my chores and tasks. I currently average 180+ usages a day with Alfred with my top level of useage at 768 times in one day! Much of that is due to the workflows I have made to help me do my work. Remember, you have to have the right tool for the right job.</p>
<p>On this page, I would like to share with you some of my tools. Maybe they will help your jobs go more smoothly! You can download each of these workflows from my <a href="https://github.com/raguay/MyAlfred" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Account</a>. The GitHub account has a directory for Alfred 2 and Alfred 3. Use the directory that matches your version of Alfred. I’m not adding new feature to the Alfred 2 workflows, but all of them have a match in the Alfred 3 directory. I highly recommend using Alfred 3.</p>
<h2 id="Workflows"><a href="#Workflows" class="headerlink" title="Workflows"></a>Workflows</h2><h2 id="Quiver-Workflow"><a href="#Quiver-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="Quiver Workflow"></a>Quiver Workflow</h2><p>This workflow allows you to create templates with Handlebar syntax inside of the <strong><a href="http://happenapps.com/#quiver" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quiver</a></strong> program. To use the workflow, you have to have Node.js installed first. I recommend using <strong><a href="http://brew.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebrew</a></strong> to install it.</p>
<p>Once <strong>Node.js</strong> is installed, go to your Quiver Library file in Alfred Browser and select the “<strong>Set Quiver Library</strong>” file action. This tells the workflow where your templates (or snippets) are to be kept. Create a workbook called “Snippets” with one note called Defaults. The Defaults note has to have one code block set to JSON and the defaults for the Handlebar expansions set. The rest of the notes will be templates.</p>
<p>When you run “<strong>qt:expand</strong>” or “<strong>qt:exptext</strong>”, it will list all of your template files in the Snippets notebook. When you select one, it will be expanded with any json cell the note and the Defaults json note data. The “<strong>qt:expand</strong>” will put the result into your clipboard and the topmost application. The “<strong>qt:exptext</strong>” will give it to TextExpander to expand and place in the topmost application. With the “<strong>qt:exptext</strong>” command, TextExpander will also expand any of it’s macros in the template file. I mostly use it for placing the cursor after expansion. These two commands also have an associated Alfred Browser File action.</p>
<p>There are four special helper function for Handlebars defined. These functions should be placed inside double or triple brackets. They are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Command</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>save <name> <text></text></name></td>
<td>This command creates a helper named “<name>” with the expanding text of “<text>”. It also places the given “<text>” at the point of definition. This allows you to create text snippets on the fly inside the template. Very handy.</text></text></name></td>

<h2 id="Template-Workflow"><a href="#Template-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="Template Workflow"></a>Template Workflow</h2><p>This workflow allows you to create templates with Handlebar syntax. To use the workflow, you have to have Node.js installed first. I recommend using <a href="http://brew.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebrew</a> to install it.</p>
<p>Once Node.js is installed, go to your snippets directory in Alfred Browser and select the <strong>Set Template Directory</strong> file action. This tells the workflow where your templates (or snippets) are to be kept.</p>
<p>You then run the <strong>tp:install</strong> to install the example templates and a default global.json file. This file should be edited to match your needs. Any data item added to this file is then passed to the Handlebar render as data. All templates have to have the “.txt” extension. If you want data to be associated with a template, then place a JSON file with the same name as the template in the t</p>
<p>When you run <strong>tp:expand</strong> or <strong>tp:exptext</strong>, it will list all of your template files in the template directory. When you select one, it will be expanded with any json file with the same name and the global json file data. The <strong>tp:expand</strong> will put the result into your clipboard and the topmost application. The <strong>tp:exptext</strong> will give it to TextExpander to expand and place in the topmost application. With the <strong>tp:exptext</strong> command, TextExpander will also expand any of it’s macros in the template file. I mostly use it for placing the cursor after expansion. These two commands also have an associated Alfred Browser File action.</p>
<p>The <strong>tp:open</strong> command opens the template/snippet directory in Alfred Browser. If you press the Command key, it will open it in the Finder.</p>
<p>The <strong>tp:editglobal</strong> will open the global.json file in your template directory with the default editor for JSON files.</p>
<p>The <strong>tp:create</strong> command requires a name. A file with that name and a “txt” extension is created in the template directory and opened in the default editor for files with a “txt” extension.</p>
<p>The <strong>tp:createclip</strong> command is the same as the <strong>tp:create</strong>, but this command takes the current clipboard contents as the text for the file. It is then opened in the default editor for “txt” files.</p>
<p>The <strong>tp:edittemplate</strong> command will give a list of templates. When you choose one, it is opened in the default editor for a file with the “txt” extension.</p>
<p>The <strong>tp:edittemplatedata</strong> command will give a list of templates. When you choose one, it’s corresponding JSON file is opened in the default editor for a JSON file.</p>
<p>There are two special helper function for Handlebars defined. The helper functions given here are just the names. They have to be inside of two curly brackets to work. This is because I use the same system on my web server to expand macros. They are:</p>

<p>There is a file action, Copy to Anybar,  that will copy a png graphic to the ~/.AnyBar directory so that it can be used with the program.</p>
<p>There are two External Triggers: SetGraphic and Launch. The SetGraphic external trigger expects a string with the name of the graphic, a ‘ | ‘, and a port number. The Launch external trigger expects a UDP port number to launch the AnyBar program on.</p>
<h2 id="Time-Stamp-Workflow"><a href="#Time-Stamp-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="Time Stamp Workflow"></a>Time Stamp Workflow</h2><p>This workflow is a demonstration on how to make a custom time stamp expander.</p>
<p>ts:stamp This causes the current time to be made into a time stamp in the format given. It then copies to clipboard.</p>
<p>This command is also trailerable with a hotkey.</p>
<h2 id="Markdown-to-Presentation-Workflow"><a href="#Markdown-to-Presentation-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="Markdown to Presentation Workflow"></a>Markdown to Presentation Workflow</h2><p>This workflow assumes that the kramdown ruby package is installed on the system already. To install, simply type in a command line:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">gem install kramdown</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Some system might require a sudo for this command. If you get an error message, try:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo gem install kramdown</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>This has a single file action that takes the given markdown file and converts it to a slide show in HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>The command <strong>mds:theme</strong> is used to set the theme. It will let the user pick from a list of themes.</p>
<p>The command <strong>mds:showtheme</strong> shows the user the currently set theme.</p>
<p>This workflow comes from my tutorial <a href="https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-slideshow-presentation-from-markdown-notes--cms-23062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Create a Slideshow Presentation From Markdown Notes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Textwell-Workflow"><a href="#Textwell-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="Textwell Workflow"></a>Textwell Workflow</h2><p>This workflow is for working with the <a href="http://sociomedia.com/textwell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Textwell</a> program for the Mac. It currently give a command for opening it quickly, <strong>tw:front</strong>. It also has:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Command</th>
<th>Description</th>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are hotkeys setup for the last two commands as well: tw:edit and tw:paste. You have to assign the hotkeys yourself. This gives similar feature as QuickCursor, though I have never used that application.</p>
<p>I am exploring more ways to extend this workflow. Keep an eye on it!</p>
<h2 id="Hammerspoon-Workflow"><a href="#Hammerspoon-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="Hammerspoon Workflow"></a>Hammerspoon Workflow</h2><p>This is a direct port of my Mjolnir Workflow.</p>

Therefore, to move the current window to the upper left most block in a 3x3 matric, you would do “hs:setgrid 0, 0, 1, 1”. There is also a hotkey set to this value as an example.</td>

<td>hs:command</td>
<td>Type in a command string and it will be sent to Hammerspoon directly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hs:expose</td>
<td>This will list all applications. When an application is selected, it will show all of it’s windows in a matrix on the screen and ask the user for the coordinates of the one to show. It will then put all the windows back to their original position and bring the one selected to the foreground. If the application has only one window, it will simply bring it to the front.</td>

<p>There is also an external trigger HammerspoonCommand that will pass whatever is sent in the trigger to Hammerspoon using the command processor as in “hs:command”. This gives other workflows or scripts the ability to interact with Hammerspoon through Alfred.</p>
<p>I also created a hotkey for doing Expose on FoldingText. The user can create more in the same manner. Just be careful to get the name of the application correct!</p>
<h2 id="Alfred-Editor"><a href="#Alfred-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Alfred Editor"></a>Alfred Editor</h2><p>This is a simple editor that makes use of <strong>Node Webkit Toolbox</strong> to run. Therefore, you need to install that workflow first. After installing this workflow, you need to execute <strong>ae:install</strong> to install the data files and the help files into their proper location. You will have a command line program called <strong>ae</strong> you can use to open files from the command line.</p>
<p>The following commands are then useable:</p>
<table>

<p>This workflow is a work in progress. I am currently working on a command prompt similar to Sublime with expandability using plugins. I also currently have only three themes. If you want to help me create themes, just send me the json file for your theme and I will include it.</p>
<h2 id="NW-js-Toolbox-formerly-Node-Webkit-Toolbox"><a href="#NW-js-Toolbox-formerly-Node-Webkit-Toolbox" class="headerlink" title="NW.js Toolbox (formerly Node Webkit Toolbox)"></a>NW.js Toolbox (formerly Node Webkit Toolbox)</h2><p>NW.js is an application for developing applications using web technologies. You can create an application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using any io.js (formerly node.js) library. There has been a move to this new version due to the node.js project in a stalemate and far behind in development compared to what Chrome is using.</p>
<p>Once you have your application developed, you can zip it up with a config.json file.</p>
<p>The workflow provides the following commands:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td>nw:help</td>
<td>Opens this help program.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are also two File Actions defined: Open Directory | that is available on directories, and Open NW.js Package | that is available on NW.js packages.</p>
<p>There are also two External Triggers: RunNWjsDirectory | and RunNWjsPackage | which work the same as the file actions. These allow external programs or other Alfred workflows to call a Node Webkit application by passing the full path of the application bundle or directory. The help option for this workflow shows an example of using these External Triggers.</p>
<p>The following code will open the help application that is located in the same directory as the code:</p>
<figure class="highlight php"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">thisDir=`pwd`;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">/usr/bin/osascript -e <span class="string">"tell application \"Alfred 2\" to run trigger \"RunNWjsDirectory\" in workflow \"com.customct.NWjs\" with argument \"$thisDir/help\""</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The directory path given in the argument tells NW.js where to load the program. It is set with the pwd command.</p>

<h2 id="Alfred-URI-Handler"><a href="#Alfred-URI-Handler" class="headerlink" title="Alfred URI Handler"></a>Alfred URI Handler</h2><p>This workflow has one command “au:install”. Once you run it, a URI handler for Alfred will be installed. This is used to trigger external triggers in any workflow. The format is:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">alfreduri://com.apple.AppleScript.AlfredURIhandler?wf=&lt;workflow Bundle ID&gt;&amp;arg=&lt;arguments&gt;&amp;ext=&lt;external trigger name&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The arguments should be URI encoded (ie: no spaces, but %20 instead). If you update the workflow, you have to re-apply the handler. Also, do not delete the workflow or the functionality will be removed.</p>
<p>You can also launch a search in Alfred with:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">alfreduri://com.apple.AppleScript.AlfredURIhandler?search=&lt;search query&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="Video-Time"><a href="#Video-Time" class="headerlink" title="Video Time"></a>Video Time</h2><p>This workflow is used to find the duration of a video. You can use the ‘getvideotime’ keyword to search for a particular video to get the duration. The ‘getvideodir’ keyword is used to scan a full directory. Both are also file actions in the Alfred browser.</p>
<h2 id="Compress-Image"><a href="#Compress-Image" class="headerlink" title="Compress Image"></a>Compress Image</h2><p>This workflow is for compressing png images to a smaller size with scaling. You have to edit the script to your image size you want to scale. Type “ci” and then a name of the image file. A list of images will be shown for you to select the one you want to compress. When using Alfred to browse files, if you view a directory, the  compress image command will show in the right arrow menu listing. You can then compress all the files in that directory. You have to have the Image Magick library and utilities already installed to use this workflow. You can now use the ‘ci.ext’ command to set the extension of the final image, which will cause conversion if set to a different type. I also added the ‘png-jpg’ and ‘jpg-png’ commands to simply convert the specifed images to the other format. The ImageMagick library is included now due to many people having problems installing it.</p>
<h2 id="Next-Item"><a href="#Next-Item" class="headerlink" title="Next Item"></a>Next Item</h2><p>This little workflow allows you to sequentially step through items in multiple list files. You use the “Next Item: Set File” file action on the file containing a list of items: One item per line. For example, a list of urls; one per line. Then the hot key (you will have to set yourself since mine being <alt><command>n will be erased) will take the next item from the specified first list and copy it to the clipboard and to a notification. If you view all lists before the first list, you will see each corresponding item for each list. The counter is only incremented after passing the item from the first list.</alt></p>

<p>The items are addressed using a zero reference. Therefore, if the counter is 1, the the second line in the file will be displayed.</p>
<p>Setting a new list will clear the count. The file specified is copied to a work area that all the other scripts will use to access it. Therefore, you do not need to worry about the original file being changed.</p>
<h2 id="Text-Massagers"><a href="#Text-Massagers" class="headerlink" title="Text Massagers"></a>Text Massagers</h2><p>I am often changing text around to different formats in large quantities. So, I made a workflow for keeping all of them. I call it text massagers because you are “massaging” the text with the script. You can use this as your template for your own massagers.

<h2 id="Alfred-Bible"><a href="#Alfred-Bible" class="headerlink" title="Alfred Bible"></a>Alfred Bible</h2><p>This workflow will request Bible passages from the “Ephesians 4:14” website:  <a href="http://www.4-14.org.uk/xml-bible-web-service-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.4-14.org.uk/xml-bible-web-service-api</a>.  Access to this API is currently free. This workflow will request the given verse from Alfred edit line or from the current OS X selection, request the verse(s), and return it in the clipboard and a notification. You can then paste it where ever you want. If you use the hotkey to search for the selected verse, it will automatically replace it with the text. There is also a hotkey to paste both versions: English and Thai. It now translates the English Bible book names to Thai. I will be adding more functionality to this workflow in the future and eventually have a full Bible study app. Let me know what functions you need.</p>
<h2 id="OctoPOW"><a href="#OctoPOW" class="headerlink" title="OctoPOW"></a>OctoPOW</h2><p>This workflow assumes you have octopuses and pow installed on your computer with each octopress site linked into the ~/.pow directory. The <a href="https://github.com/phallstrom/AlfredPow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">POW workflow</a> is a great compliment to this workflow and is called by the preview function. First, set up your editor with “octopow:editor”. Then, set you current POW project with “octopow”. You can create/edit/delete posts with “octopow:post”. You can generate your site and preview it in POW using “octopow:preview”. You can then deploy you changes with “octopow:deploy”. This workflow assumes you have already setup your Octopress site and POW programs on your system. More to come!</p>
<p>All workflows now work with AlleyOop, except where mentioned otherwise. Please let me know if you have any problems, suggestions, or commits.</p>
<h2 id="Run-Chrome-with-Accessibility"><a href="#Run-Chrome-with-Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="Run Chrome with Accessibility"></a>Run Chrome with Accessibility</h2><p>This workflow allows you to launch Chrome with the accessibility flag set so that you can use <a href="http://shortcatapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShortCat.app</a> with Chrome. It uses ctl-shift-h to launch Chrome or bring it to the front if running. ctl-shift-alt-h to quit Chrome.</p>
<h2 id="Sermon-Scheduler"><a href="#Sermon-Scheduler" class="headerlink" title="Sermon Scheduler"></a>Sermon Scheduler</h2><p>This workflow aid in the creating of my sermon schedules. Use ss:setdirectory to set the directory for sermons (or whatever you want to create schedules from a template). The use ss:seteditor to set the editor you want to use (I use Sublime). You then can use ss:create to make a new schedule by the template (you might want to edit the template first with the ss:edit and selecting the template). Then use ss:edit to edit one of the schedules or the template.</p>
<p>The unique thing about the workflow is that new schedule’s name will always be something like: 2014-Feb02-Feb08.md. The current year, first day of the week and the last day of the week. The ss:create gives you names for the current week and the next 4 weeks.</p>
<p>This works great for me being a missionary. You can change it to meet your own needs.</p>
<h2 id="Scratch-Pad"><a href="#Scratch-Pad" class="headerlink" title="Scratch Pad"></a>Scratch Pad</h2><p>Sometimes you just need a place to edit some text quickly. Or, simply write a short note to store in the clipboard history (it actually works better than you think). That is where this workflow comes in handy.</p>
<p>After you set a hotkey, you can select text and edit it on the Alfred command line. When you press enter, it will be placed into the clipboard. If you press <code><cmd></cmd></code> and enter, it will place it into the clipboard and the top most application.</p>
<p>If you invoke the keyword “sp:” or if you press the hotkey without a selection, it will offer to put the clipboard as the text to edit. Press enter on the “clipboard” option and the contents of the clipboard will be copied to the Alfred command line for editing.</p>
<h2 id="DwellClick-Workflow"><a href="#DwellClick-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="DwellClick Workflow"></a>DwellClick Workflow</h2><p>This workflow has commands for <a href="https://pilotmoon.com/dwellclick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DwellClick from Pilotmoon</a>. You can:</p>
