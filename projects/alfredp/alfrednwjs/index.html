You can create an application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using any io.js (formerly node.js) library. There has been a move to this new version due to the node.js project in a stalemate and far behind in development compared to what Chrome is using.</p>

<p>Once you have your application developed, you can zip it up with a config.json file.</p>

<p>The workflow provides the following commands:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Command</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>nw:website</td>
<td>This opens the NW.js website on GitHub. If you hold down the &lt;cmd&gt; key, it will open the io.js website.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>nw:open</td>
<td>When the user starts typing, a file ending in the &ldquo;.nw&rdquo; extension is looked for according to the work typed. Therefore, if there is a file called &ldquo;new.nw&rdquo;, as soon as &ldquo;n&rdquo; is typed , that file will be displayed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>nw:opendir</td>
<td>Opens the current directory in Finder or Path Finder using Node Webkit. The config.json file should be in that directory.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>nw:help</td>
<td>Opens this help program.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>There are also two File Actions defined: <em>Open Directory</em> that is available on directories, and <em>Open NW.js Package</em> that is available on NW.js packages.</p>

<p>There are also two External Triggers: <em>RunNWjsDirectory</em> and <em>RunNWjsPackage</em> which work the same as the file actions. These allow external programs or other Alfred workflows to call a Node Webkit application by passing the full path of the application bundle or directory. The help option for this workflow shows an example of using these External Triggers.</p>

<p>The following code will open the help application that is located in the same directory as the code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">thisDir=`pwd`;

/usr/bin/osascript -e &quot;tell application \&quot;Alfred 2\&quot; to run trigger \&quot;RunNWjsDirectory\&quot; in workflow \&quot;com.customct.NWjs\&quot; with argument \&quot;$thisDir/help\&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The directory path given in the argument tells NW.js where to load the program. It is set with the <em>pwd</em> command.</p>

<p>There will be more tutorials and hacks using this workflow on my website <a href="http://customct.com">Custom Computer Tools</a>.</p>
