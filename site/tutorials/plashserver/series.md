title: Series on Creating a Local Plash Server Using Svelte

# {{title}}

#### {{cdate date 'MMMM D, YYYY'}}

This is the main index for my tutorial series on creating a Plash server using
Svelte and Nodejs. This series will show you the basics and advance usage of
Svelte in a fun project. Since I have two full time jobs, my update to this
series might be somewhat slow.

All code for this series will be in the [SveltePlashServer](https://github.com/raguay/SveltePlashServer)
GitHub repository. This repository will have the final code, not a step wise code
increment. That is easer way for me to manage it all.

If you come up with some additions to the project, just fork the repository, 
add the new code, and send me a pull request. It would be great to get a 
community around this project.
