This is a toolbox of functions for working with the [Fish Shell](http://fishshell.com/).  You can install fish shell with homebrew:

```bash
   brew install fish
```

Currently, the functions are:

| Command        | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
