This workflow has commands for [DwellClick from Pilotmoon](https://pilotmoon.com/dwellclick/). You can:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| dc:enable   | Enable DwellClick |
| dc:disable  | Disable DwellClick |
| dc:action   | Performs the action selected. This is a script filter that will list all possible actions. If the command key is pressed, it delays the action for the next dwell click. If the function key is pressed, then the action is sted for use with the first hotkey action. |

The first hotkey action is for performing the stored action. The second is an example of making a fixed action to an hotkey. Very useful.
