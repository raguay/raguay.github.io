This workflow will request Bible passages from the "Ephesians 4:14" website:  http://www.4-14.org.uk/xml-bible-web-service-api.  Access to this API is currently free. This workflow will request the given verse from Alfred edit line or from the current OS X selection, request the verse(s), and return it in the clipboard and a notification. You can then paste it where ever you want. If you use the hotkey to search for the selected verse, it will automatically replace it with the text. There is also a hotkey to paste both versions: English and Thai. It now translates the English Bible book names to Thai. I will be adding more functionality to this workflow in the future and eventually have a full Bible study app. Let me know what functions you need.
