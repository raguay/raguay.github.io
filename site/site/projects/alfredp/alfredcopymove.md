This workflow starts with a **Add Directory to Copy/Move locations...** File Action to create a list of directories to use as targets for a copy/move operation. If actioned on a file, the directory of the file is saved.

Once you have a list, you can use **copy to...** or **move to...** file actions to move or copy files to a previously saved directory.

The keyword **cm:fav** is used to view saved directories, remove one, go to one in Alfred Browser, or open in Finder.
