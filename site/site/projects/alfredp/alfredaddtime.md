I am often needing to add up a series to times in a document. This workflow makes it very easy. Clear the accumulator, select a time value, and hit your hotkey combination you assigned in this workflow. The time will be accumulated. You can show the time in Hr:min:sec format or just plain minutes. Have fun!

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| ta:clear   | This clears the accumulator |
| ta:showmin | Show the accumulated time in just minutes. |
| ta:showhr  | Show the accumulated time |

There is a hotkey you need to set for adding the currently selected time.
