#### {{cdate date 'MMMM D, YYYY'}}

I stated a new series of tutorials around the [Plash](https://sindresorhus.com/plash) program for the macOS.
The Plash program allows you to put any web page as the background for your mac.
Since I like to have dynamic backgrounds that I can easily change around with
widgets, I decided to create a special server for just this task. It's based on
using the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) JavaScript framework and makes for a great tutorial on how
to use the different features of this framework. Join me for all the fun!
