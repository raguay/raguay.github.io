#### {{cdate date 'MMMM D, YYYY'}}

I created a repository on GitHub with a minimum configuration to be used for a 
template in creating other websites. You can get the [template here](https://github.com/raguay/SvelteGithubSiteTemplate).

Please try it out and let me know your experiences with it. I will be adding to
it and trying to create tutorials on using it as well. It is very basic right now,
but it does have growth potential.

I added the sidebar with my twitter timeline and a list of blog posts. Now, the 
sidebar doesn't look so bare! I'm hoping to continue to add more to it over time,
but having two full time jobs makes working on it very hard!
