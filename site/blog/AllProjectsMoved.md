Well, all the project pages have been moved over to this new site. Now, I need time to add to it as not all of my projects are currently listed.

I'm not sure about moving over my tutorials as they were never overly popular. But, I most likely will move over the ones that I personally like. If there is one you would like to make sure is moved over, just let me know.

I've also moved to the [Icarus](https://blog.zhangruipeng.me/hexo-theme-icarus/) theme for [Hexo](http://hexo.io). It is a very nice theme with many options. I'll be customizing it more and more as I learn to use Hexo and the Icarus theme.
