### Favorite Software Tools


Since my site is about software tools for your computer, I thought I would share what tools I find useful and fun. Every tool on this page are tools that I use on a regular basis. Some are free, some are not. But, all of them are extremely useful tools. They are not listed in any particular order. I will be adding on to this list, so check by often! I hope you enjoy!

By the way, what is your favorite tool? Let everyone know!

### macOS

Here are some of my favorite tools on the Mac. I use these about everyday.

- [fman](http://www.fman.io)

    Everyone needs a great file manager. Fman is the hackers best file manager. In the basic configuration, it is very much like Norton Commander was on Dos systems. But, fman is a full graphics based file manager that is extendable with python. I highly recommand it.

    fman is also multi-platform program. One license and you can run it on all your system. I currently use it on macOS, Peppermint Linux, and Windows. Not all extensions work on each OS, but many do.

    You can check my tutorial on writing custom extensions for [fman on Tuts+](https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/fman-the-extendable-file-manager-for-any-system--cms-28340). You can see a list of all my extensions [here](/#/projects/fman).

- [Oni2](https://v2.onivim.io/)

  When the news of Sublime Text 3 full version upgrade when released (11/1/2019 - Still
  a beta program) would cost $75, I decided I needed to move back to Emacs. But, Emacs
  opens very slowing at times. I was also moving to the Vim editing style. While
  looking for a good Vim editor, I came across Oni and loved it. But, Oni kept crashing
  all the time. Then came Oni2. It's still in Alpha state, but I'm using it all the time
  and loving it. I'm really missing [Emmet](https://emmet.io/) functionality, but that will be coming soon.
  Right now, Oni2 is my main editor and it is fast!
  
- [Alfred 4](http://alfredapp.com)

    This great little program saves me many hours of time and keystrokes. It is a program launcher, file system explorer, hotkey runner, text expander, clipboard history manager, itunes controller, ...  There is no end to how you can use this program to help you use your computer. It is easily expanded using workflows. You can check out some of my [workflows](/#/projects/alfred)!

- [Bitbar](https://getbitbar.com/)

  This is a free program to put the output of scripts into your menubar. It works great, but hasn't had an update since
  August of 2016. Therefore, it is most likely dead, but still usable. It will not run on Catalina. My personal scripts
  and tutorials are found on my [Bitbar page](/#/projects/bitbar).

- [TextBar](http://richsomerfield.com/apps/textbar/)

  TextBar is a for pay version of Bitbar. The mechanics are quit different and TextBar has a html render mode that
  Bitbar doesn't have. You can find my scripts for [Textbar here](/#/projects/textbar).
  

- [MaxSnap](https://a.paddle.com/click?said=426&aaid=1133&link_id=229&chk=93fb9c86ac7786bfa6928b4f5c4ddf91&redir=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3RlaWZ5YXBwLmNvbS9tYXhzbmFwLXdpbmRvd3MtbWFuYWdlci1mb3ItbWFjLw==)

    Controling the large number of windows open can sometimes really be hard. I use MaxSnap to make it easier. My favorite feature is the moving and resizing windows with the mouse.

- [Growly Notes](http://growlybird.com/notes/index.html)

    This program comes the closest to giving the Mac community the flexibility and utility of Microsoft Office Onenote. I use it to store facts and to organism anything that I write. Being a free program, anyone can use it. But, if you find it useful, please give a donation for the continued development of the program.

- [DEVONthink Pro](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html)
    
    I just recently started using this powerful program. It would best be called a thought management system for the Mac. It allows the tagging and linking of files or database entries in the program for intelligently managing them. It uses AppleScript for it's scripting language and give very helpful tools to make the scripts accessable all the time. You can quickly jot notes and throw it into the inbox for filing latter. With the Alfred workflows for it, you can very quickly jot a note to be more fully developed later. It is also an excellent web site bookmarker/archiver. Searching all the content is quick and easy.

- [Dropzone](http://aptonic.com/)

    If you do not have Dropzone, I would recommend it. It has many pre-programmed destinations to process files and text. But, if you can not find what you need, you can easily write your own in Ruby! For a person that loves to program, this tool is very fun!

    Read my tutorial on [Writing Dropzone 3 Actions](http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/writing-dropzone-3-actions--cms-21590)

- [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)

    This handy keyboard utility makes writing automation scripts on the Mac very easy. Also, you can expand your clipboards and do all kinds of things. Definitely give it a try!

- [Typinator](http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/)

    This great utility program helps speed up your workflow a whole lot. Many of the same things can be done with Alfred, but Alfred does not allow for inputing information in fields of the text clip. Therefore, this program is much more versatile. I actually make use of both for text expanding and love it.

- [DwellClick](https://pilotmoon.com/dwellclick/)

    This nifty little utility will click for you when you stop moving the cursor. It is very handy and help those with problem clicking the mouse a whole lot.

- [RCDefaultApp](http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/)

    This free utility for setting default programs to almost any protocal in the Mac OS.

- [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm)

    This program is similar to Camtasia above, but works best at making mp4 files. Since my job has standardized mostly on mp4, this is my main video editing software.

- Yummy FTP

  This was my choice program, but it is dead now because the author died. He was the lone developer and not a real
  company. It will be sorely missed as it doesn't work on Catalina.

- [CyberDuck](http://cyberduck.ch/)

    This a great FTP, SFTP client that is free and on Windows as well.

- [MediaInfo](http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en)

    This nice little program will give you all kinds of information about a video. This is very useful to check videos for possible encoder incompatibility.

- [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/)

    This is a great, free graphics editing program. I use it all the time to trim down screenshots to the proper size.

- [Auphonics](http://auphonic.com/)

    This great program is most useful for increasing the volume of a audio file. It also does a great job cleaning up many unwanted sounds.

- [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/)

    This is a great, free program for cleaning up audio files. It has many built-in filters for making the audio sound as good as possible.

- [Name Mangler](http://manytricks.com/namemangler/)

    This is a must have program for renaming files.

- [PopClip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/)

    This utility program has saved me a lot of hand moving around time. It gives a very handy, programmable popup for copying the current selection (or a lot of other things).

- [Grisbi](http://www.grisbi.org/)
    
    This is an excellent, personal money management software for Windows, Mac OSx and Linux.

- [ShortCat](http://shortcatapp.com/)
    
    This utility makes almost everything on the screen keyboard accessable. You definitely need this in your toolbox.

- [Affinity Photo, Designer, and Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/)

  These are my goto programs for working with graphics and publishing needs. They are fast, dependable, and fully
  compatable with similar Adobe products (file formats. Plugins are not fully compatable, but many do work). Also, these
  will not break your bank! All are available for Windows as well.

### Microsoft Windows

Here are some of the tools I use on Windows. Many of the tools I use on macOS is also on Windows. Therefore, I will not repeat those.

- [Microsoft Office](www.microsoft.com/office)

    This is still the best office suit. Word is a great document writer, Excel is the best overall spreadsheet program, and OneNote is one of the best ideal processors/note taking software around.

- [theWord](http://www.theword.net/)

    This is an excellent Bible study software, but it is only on Windows. It runs great in the Mac under Parrallels. Paired with [theWord Modules Library](http://www.twmodules.com/), you have access to almost every bit of Christian literature that is in e-format.

- [Phrase Express](http://www.phraseexpress.com/)

    This great utility program helps speed up your workflow a whole lot. It is also compatable to Text Expander for the Mac.

- [Ditto](http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net/)

    Ditto is a must have program on Windows. It allows you to manage and control your clipboard. I use it a whole lot!

### Linux Programs

I would list the programs I use on Linux, but I would just be repeating myself! Everything has been covered above. There is really nothing that is Linux only that I use. Maybe someone can suggest some!
