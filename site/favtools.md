### Favorite Frameworks

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is my preferred framework to use for making web based sites or programs. I have created many web based tools using [Wails](wails.io) and the Svelte framework. It is also the framework that is running this website. You can use my template project, [Svelte GitHub Site Template ](https://github.com/raguay/SvelteGithubSiteTemplate)to build your own.

### Favorite Software Tools

Since my site is about software tools for your computer, I thought I would share what tools I find useful and fun. Every tool on this page are tools that I use on a regular basis. Some are free, some are not. But, all of them are extremely useful tools. They are not listed in any particular order. I will be adding on to this list, so check by often! I hope you enjoy!

By the way, what is your favorite tool? Let everyone know!

### macOS

Here are some of my favorite tools on the Mac. I use these about everyday.

- [EmailIt](https://github.com/raguay/EmailIt)

  EmailIt is a program for sending markdown emails. It also has templates, scripts for processing text, and much more. It is an open source program I'm creating for my own use and believe others can benefit from it as well.

- [Modal File Manager](https://GitHub.com/raguay/ModalFileManager)

  Since fman isn't actively being developed anymore and I really don't like Python as an extension language, I developed my own file manager using Wails and Svelte. It's a vim style hotkey system with themes and extensions downloadable from GitHub.

- [BullitenBoard](https://github.com/raguay/BulletinBoard)

  BullitenBoard is a programmable dialog and message posting program. I use it for scripting dialogs to get information from a user.

- [ScriptBar](https://GitHub.com/raguay/scriptbarapp)

  ScriptBar is similar to xBar, but puts information from scripts in a drop down instead of in the menubar.

- [fman](http://www.fman.io)

  Everyone needs a great file manager. Fman is the hackers best file manager. In the basic configuration, it is very much like Norton Commander was on Dos systems. But, fman is a full graphics based file manager that is extendable with python. I highly recommand it.

  fman is also multi-platform program. One license and you can run it on all your system. I currently use it on macOS, Peppermint Linux, and Windows. Not all extensions work on each OS, but many do.

  You can check my tutorial on writing custom extensions for [fman on Tuts+](https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/fman-the-extendable-file-manager-for-any-system--cms-28340). You can see a list of all my extensions [here](/#/projects/fman).

- [Oni2](https://v2.onivim.io/)

  When the news of Sublime Text 3 full version upgrade would cost $75, I decided I needed to move back to Emacs. But, Emacs opens very slowing at times. I was also moving to the Vim editing style. While looking for a good Vim editor, I came across Oni and loved it. But, Oni kept crashing all the time. Then came Oni2. It's still in Alpha state, but I'm using it all the time and loving it. Unfortunately, it has become vaporware and not currently supported ☹️. But, I still use it a lot.

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/](https://neovim.io/)

  With Oni2 no longer being actively supported, I’ve switch to using Neovim for my main code editing. It’s a great editor and very versatile. Using the [Bob](https://github.com/MordechaiHadad/bob) updater means I always have the best version available.

- [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com)

  This great little program saves me many hours of time and keystrokes. It is a program launcher, file system explorer, hotkey runner, text expander, clipboard history manager, itunes controller, and so much more! There is no end to how you can use this program to help you use your computer. It is easily expanded using workflows. You can check out some of my [workflows](/#/projects/alfred)!

- [xbar](https://getbitbar.com/)

  This is a free program to put the output of scripts into your menubar. My personal scripts
  and tutorials are found on my [Bitbar page](/#/projects/bitbar).

- [MaxSnap](https://a.paddle.com/click?said=426&aaid=1133&link_id=229&chk=93fb9c86ac7786bfa6928b4f5c4ddf91&redir=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3RlaWZ5YXBwLmNvbS9tYXhzbmFwLXdpbmRvd3MtbWFuYWdlci1mb3ItbWFjLw==)

  Controling the large number of windows open can sometimes really be hard. I use MaxSnap to make it easier. My favorite feature is the moving and resizing windows with the mouse.

- [Growly Notes](http://growlybird.com/notes/index.html)

  This program comes the closest to giving the Mac community the flexibility and utility of Microsoft Office Onenote. I use it to store facts and to organism anything that I write. Being a free program, anyone can use it. But, if you find it useful, please give a donation for the continued development of the program.

- [Dropzone](http://aptonic.com/)

  If you do not have Dropzone, I would recommend it. It has many pre-programmed destinations to process files and text. But, if you can not find what you need, you can easily write your own in Ruby! For a person that loves to program, this tool is very fun!

  Read my tutorial on [Writing Dropzone 3 Actions](http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/writing-dropzone-3-actions--cms-21590)

- [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)

  This handy keyboard utility makes writing automation scripts on the Mac very easy. Also, you can expand your clipboards and do all kinds of things. Definitely give it a try!

- [Typinator](http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/)

  This great utility program helps speed up your workflow a whole lot. Many of the same things can be done with Alfred, but Alfred does not allow for inputing information in fields of the text clip. Therefore, this program is much more versatile. I actually make use of both for text expanding and love it.

- [DwellClick](https://pilotmoon.com/dwellclick/)

  This nifty little utility will click for you when you stop moving the cursor. It is very handy and help those with problem clicking the mouse a whole lot.

- [RCDefaultApp](http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/)

  This free utility for setting default programs to almost any protocal in the Mac OS.

- [MediaInfo](http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en)

  This nice little program will give you all kinds of information about a video. This is very useful to check videos for possible encoder incompatibility.

- [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/)

  This is a great, free graphics editing program. I use it all the time to trim down screenshots to the proper size.

- [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/)

  This is a great, free program for cleaning up audio files. It has many built-in filters for making the audio sound as good as possible.

- [Name Mangler](http://manytricks.com/namemangler/)

  This is a must have program for renaming files.

- [PopClip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/)

  This utility program has saved me a lot of hand moving around time. It gives a very handy, programmable popup for copying the current selection (or a lot of other things).

- [ShortCat](http://shortcatapp.com/)

  This utility makes almost everything on the screen keyboard accessable. You definitely need this in your toolbox.

- [Affinity Photo, Designer, and Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/)

  These are my goto programs for working with graphics and publishing needs. They are fast, dependable, and fully compatable with similar Adobe products (file formats. Plugins are not fully compatable, but many do work). Also, these will not break your bank! All are available for Windows as well.

### Linux Programs

I would list the programs I use on Linux, but I would just be repeating myself! Everything has been covered above. There is really nothing that is Linux only that I use. Maybe someone can suggest some!
