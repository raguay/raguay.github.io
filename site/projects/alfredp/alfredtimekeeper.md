A time tracking extension that allows for any number of projects and tracking the time between them. Still early stage, but very useable. It also has a basic graphical viewing of work hours with a calendar for lookup. I have started recreating some of the PHP scripts as full go language programs. Please let me know if you have any problems. The following keywords are used:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| atk:addproject | This allows you to create a new project |
| atk:project | This allows you to set the current project |
| atk:state | This allows you to set the current state of a project. |
| atk:help | Gives a list of commands for Alfred Time Keeper |
| atk:current | This will show the current project, time, and state. |
| atk:week | This shows the time for the current project this week. |
| atk:month | This shows the time for the current project this month. |
| atk:worktime | This displays the time worked on all project for a particular day. |
