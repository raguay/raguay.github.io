The only keyword is **ff** for "Find a Folder". It is a way to lookup a folding in the Alfred browser or in Finder. Very handy.

There are two Alfred browser actions:

**Create a File**

Simply creates a file in the directory this file action is ran on. It will ask you for the name and then create it.

**Create a Directory**

Same as "Create a File", but creates a directory instead.

More coming in the future!
