These commands are for working with the slap terminal editor easier. You can learn more about slap at https://github.com/slap-editor/slap

**slap:edit**
	Gets the file in Finder or Pathfinder and opens it in iTerm using slap.

**slap:install**
	Runs the npm install for slap. It is assumed that node and npm are already installed. The best way to install node is with HomeBrew (http://brew.io).

A hotKey is setup to take the current OS X selection and open it in slap.
