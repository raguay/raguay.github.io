This workflow assumes you have octopuses and pow installed on your computer with each octopress site linked into the ~/.pow directory. The [POW workflow](https://github.com/phallstrom/AlfredPow) is a great compliment to this workflow and is called by the preview function. First, set up your editor with "octopow:editor". Then, set you current POW project with "octopow". You can create/edit/delete posts with "octopow:post". You can generate your site and preview it in POW using "octopow:preview". You can then deploy you changes with "octopow:deploy". This workflow assumes you have already setup your Octopress site and POW programs on your system. More to come!

All workflows now work with AlleyOop, except where mentioned otherwise. Please let me know if you have any problems, suggestions, or commits.
