This workflow is for programing using the [Picat](http://picat-lang.org/) language. The following commands are available:

**pic:install**
This will download and install Picat in to the ~/Documents directory. It then sets up the variables to use in all the other commands.

**pic:showdir**
This shows the directory of the install Picat program to the user.

**pic:setscript**
This sets the Picat script to execute in the other commands.

**pic:editscript**
This opens the Picat script in to the code editor that is setup with **pic:seteditor**.

**pic:seteditor**
This allows for setting the code editor to use to edit Picate scripts.

**pic:run**
This runs the currently selected Picat script.

**pic:suser**
This opens the Picat User Manual.

**pic:stutorial**
This opens the Picat Tutorial.

**pic:sstarted**
This opens the Picat Getting Started Manual.

There are also three File commands to use in the Alfred Browser:

**Edit Picat File**
Allows you to edit the selected Picat file in the Alfred Browser using the editor setup in the **pic:seteditor**.

**Run Picat File**
This runs the current Picat file in the Alfred Browser.

**Run Files through Picat Program**
