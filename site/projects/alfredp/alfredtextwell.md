This workflow is for working with the [Textwell](http://sociomedia.com/textwell/) program for the Mac. It currently give a command for opening it quickly, **tw:front**. It also has:

**tw:edit**
This copies the selected text and pastes it into TextWell. It also saves the name of the application that the text was copied from.

**tw:paste**
This copies what is in TextWell and pastes it back into the application that the text was copied from.

There are hotkeys setup for the last two commands as well: tw:edit and tw:paste. You have to assign the hotkeys yourself. This gives similar feature as QuickCursor, though I have never used that application.

I am exploring more ways to extend this workflow. Keep an eye on it!
