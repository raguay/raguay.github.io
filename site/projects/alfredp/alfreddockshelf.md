This workflow is for automating the [DockShelf](http://www.thealchemistguild.com/dockshelf/) program. The following items are defined:

### Commands:

**ds:space**

This command will show a list of workspaces currently defined. You can narrow the list by typing part of a name. Selecting one causes DockShelf to switch to that workspace.

### External Triggers

**Focus Named Workspace**

This external trigger will switch to the workspace given.
