This workflow gives some added features for ExpanDrive. You can use the hotkey "<ctrl><alt><cmd>e" to change the current selection in Finder or Path Finder that is in a subdirectory for a ExpanDrive drive to a web facing reference to that file. You set up the ExpanDrive name using the "ed:edir" keyword. You then can set the web facing directory prefix with "ed:wdir". The scripts currently do not check for accuracy, that is up to the user.
