This workflow is for keeping track of budgets <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calca/id635758264?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Calca.app</a>. You can set a budget template ("b:budget" keyword and selecting "Edit Template"), and then create budgets each month ("b:budget" keyword and selecting "Make from Template"). The "b:budget" keyword will also show all of the available budget files that you can view and/or edit.
