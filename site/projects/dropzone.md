I have really enjoyed the Dropzone program for the Mac. It is a platform of utilities for processing files and text. If there is not an action you need already, then just create it yourself! Each action is a directory with a Ruby or Python file, configuration file, and an icon file with the extension ".dropzone". You can view alternate [actions here](http://aptonic.com/extend.php) or fork Dropzone's [GitHub account](https://github.com/aptonic/dropzone-user-scripts), add your action, and give a pull request.

As I write new actions, I will add them to the list below.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [UnpackZipDir.dropzone](https://github.com/aptonic/dropzone-user-scripts/blob/master/UnpackZiptoDir.dropzone) | This destination will allow the user to click on it to set a destination directory. After that, any file(s) dragged on to it will be unzipped into that directory. Works great for installing new books into theWord Bible program. |

I have also written an article on writing destinations for Mac Tuts+. It is called:
