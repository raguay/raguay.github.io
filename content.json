It helps me in all of my chores and tasks. I currently average 180+ usages a day with Alfred with my top level of useage at 768 times in one day! Much of that is due to the workflows I have made to help me do my work. Remember, you have to have the right tool for the right job. On this page, I would like to share with you some of my tools. Maybe they will help your jobs go more smoothly! You can download each of these workflows from my GitHub Account. The GitHub account has a directory for Alfred 2 and Alfred 3. Use the directory that matches your version of Alfred. I’m not adding new feature to the Alfred 2 workflows, but all of them have a match in the Alfred 3 directory. I highly recommend using Alfred 3.

Before I trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ to save me from my sins, I was an Electrical Engineer and Programmer by trade. You can read my testimony of salvation and my resume. I still love to program and have kept up with the times somewhat. Since then, the hard economic times and various reasons, our support is no longer sufficient for all of our medical and educational needs. Since I have a skill, I felt led of God to do as Paul did in supplying his needs through his skills to help when others are not able (Acts 20:34 “Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.”). The result is this website. All the computer tools found here I have found useful in the construction and maintenance of several websites. I hope you too find them useful. Tutorials Written on Other SitesI also write tutorials for Computer Tuts+. I try to mention the articles in the areas that I already have similar topics on this site (ie. Alfred articles are listed on my Alfred Workflows page).

The easiest way to install is by home-brew cask: brew cask install anybar If you do not have home-brew cask installed, follow the instructions here: HomeBrew Cask. If you do not have HomeBrew installed, follow the instructions here: HomeBrew. Then execute the above line. Once installed, you can use the features of this workflow: anybar:launchLaunches anybar with optional port number. anybar:setgraphicSet the graphic for the anybar application. It will give a list of usable graphics. Start typing and the list will be narrowed down to the ones that match. Select the one and the last launched Anybar will be changed to that graphic. anybar:setportThis allows you to set the port number of the AnyBar app. anybar:setupThis copies the graphics I created to the ~/.AnyBar directory. There is a file action, Copy to Anybar, that will copy a png graphic to the ~/.AnyBar directory so that it can be used with the program. There are two External Triggers: SetGraphic and Launch. The SetGraphic external trigger expects a string with the name of the graphic, a ‘|’, and a port number. The Launch external trigger expects a UDP port number to launch the AnyBar program on.","link":"/alfred-anybar/index.html"},{"title":"Alfred Bible","text":"This workflow will request Bible passages from the “Ephesians 4:14” website: http://www.4-14.org.uk/xml-bible-web-service-api. Access to this API is currently free. This workflow will request the given verse from Alfred edit line or from the current OS X selection, request the verse(s), and return it in the clipboard and a notification. You can then paste it where ever you want. If you use the hotkey to search for the selected verse, it will automatically replace it with the text. There is also a hotkey to paste both versions: English and Thai. It now translates the English Bible book names to Thai.

You have to edit the script to your image size you want to scale. Type “ci” and then a name of the image file. A list of images will be shown for you to select the one you want to compress. When using Alfred to browse files, if you view a directory, the compress image command will show in the right arrow menu listing. You can then compress all the files in that directory. You have to have the Image Magick library and utilities already installed to use this workflow. You can now use the ‘ci.ext’ command to set the extension of the final image, which will cause conversion if set to a different type. I also added the ‘png-jpg’ and ‘jpg-png’ commands to simply convert the specifed images to the other format. The ImageMagick library is included now due to many people having problems installing it.","link":"/alfred-compressimage/index.html"},{"title":"Copy/Move to Workflow","text":"This workflow starts with a Add Directory to Copy/Move locations… File Action to create a list of directories to use as targets for a copy/move operation. If actioned on a file, the directory of the file is saved. Once you have a list, you can use copy to… or move to… file actions to move or copy files to a previously saved directory.

Very useful.","link":"/alfred-dwellclick/index.html"},{"title":"Alfred Editor","text":"This is a simple editor that makes use of Node Webkit Toolbox to run. Therefore, you need to install that workflow first. After installing this workflow, you need to execute ae:install to install the data files and the help files into their proper location. You will have a command line program called ae you can use to open files from the command line. The following commands are then useable: ae:openeditor This simply opens Alfred Editor without a file. ae:edit The currently selected file in Path Finder or Finder is opened in Alfred Editor. You also have an Alfred Browser command for opening files as well. An external command for opening files is available as well. ae:open This script filter gives several important directory locations that can be opened in the Alfred browser or Finder. ae:theme This script filter lists all the available themes. If you select one, that will be the new theme for windows opened in Alfred Editor. If you hold the command key while selecting, that theme will be opened in Alfred Editor to edit. ae:createtheme This allows you to create a new theme to use in Alfred Editor. It will request a new name, create the new theme from lesser-dark them, and open in Alfred Editor to edit. You will still have to select the theme for it to be used. ae:windowlist This will list each available Alfred Editor window name. The one selected will be brought to the front using the Mjolnir Workflow. The Mjolnir workflow has to be installed for this command to work. ae:keyboard This command allows you to choose either the Sublime keyboard layout or the Vim keyboard layout to use in Alfred Editor. If the Sublime layout is chosen, then the status line will always show it to be in insert mode. This workflow is a work in progress. I am currently working on a command prompt similar to Sublime with expandability using plugins. I also currently have only three themes.

But, you can set any other editor you want as well. Since TaskPaper uses plain text files for everything, it is easy to write scripts to add functionality that the program does not have. So far, I have the following keywords defined: Command Description t:settodo This command allows you to set the directory for your todos. It will setup the supporting files and sub-directories as well. This is the first action to perform with this workflow. t:createtodaytodo This command will take the everyday, weekly, monthly, and dated todos and combine them to the left over todos from the last time you created todos. It will also archive the finished todos. Todos that are repeated from the dated category are reset according to the repeat pattern. t:showtoday This command will open todays (or the most current) todo list in TaskPaper. t:showyesterday This command will open yesterdays (or the one before the most current) todo list in TaskPaper. t:showfinished This command will open the archived done tasks in TaskPaper. t:addmonthlytodo This command will ask for the day of the month and the task. It will then place that in the monthly todo directory for that day. When a new todo list is created, then it will pull in that days tasks. t:addeveryday This adds a task to the everyday task list. Every task placed in this list will be added to the current todo list everytime it is created. t:addweekdaytask This command will ask for the day of the week and the task. It will then place that it in the weekly todo directory for that day of the week. When a new todo list is created, then it will pull in that days tasks. t:doing This creates a new dated entry for the current journal. It will ask which journal to place the entry into. The standard doing.txt journal will automatically be created. t:showdoing This opens the current doing journal in TaskPaper. t:showprojects This opens the projects task file in TaskPaper. This is for ongoing projects and their tasks. t:sortdone This command takes the topmost TaskPaper list and sorts all of the done tag entries to the bottom. t:seteditor This command is for setting the text editor to use. t:newjournal This command will allow you to create new journal files. t:showjournal This command is for opening a journal in the editor. It will ask which journal and give you the current list of journals. t:settz This command is for setting the time zone. A list of time zones will be given and you select the one you are in. t:showtz This command will show the currently set time zone. t:next This finds the tag @next, marks that task done, and adds it to the next task. t:adddatedtask This allows you to add a task on a particular date that can repeat also.

It also shows all dated tasks and allows for deleting them. t:managemonthly This allows you to pick a monthly task and edit the file or delete the file. t:manageweekly This allows you to pick a weekly task to edit or delete. t:editeverydaytask This allows you to edit the everyday task file.","link":"/alfred-foldingtext/index.html"},{"title":"Hammerspoon Workflow","text":"This is a direct port of my Mjolnir Workflow. This workflow is for running scripts using Hammerspoon to control your windows. This is just a sample of the things that can be done. Follow this layout and you can do many neat things with Hammerspoon. First off, download Hammerspoon from https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/releases/latest. Once installed, reload Hammerspoon and run the “hs:install” to set the configuration file this workflow expects. After that, everything should just work. hs:install Configure Hammerspoon with the configuration file that this workflow needs. The original is backed up into the users home directory as hs.orig. hs:reload This tells Hammerspoon to reload the configuration file. hs:open This opens the Hammerspoon console to the foreground. hs:nup This nudges the current window up. hs:ndown This nudges the current window down. hs:nleft This nudges the current window to the left. hs:nright This nudges the current window to the right. hs:tcaff This toggles system caffenate. hs:leftthirds This moves the current window to the left 1/3 of the screen. hs:rightthirds This moves the current window to the right 2/3 of the screen. hs:lefthalf This moves the current window to the left half of the screen. hs:righthalf This moves the current window to the right half of the screen. hs:tophalfThis moves the current window to the top half of the screen. hs:bottomhalfThis moves the current window to the bottom half of the screen. hs:fullScreenThis moves the window to the maximum size on the screen. hs:minimizeThis minimizes the current window. hs:tzoomThis toggles the system fullscreen on and off for the current window. This moves the window to it’s own space taking up the entire screen. hs:runningThis will list all the running apps. You can then just select one to bring it to the front, select with alt key to hide it, select with ctrl key to unhide it, and select with the fn key to close the application. hs:snap This snaps the current window to the closes grid box area. hs:setgrid This requires you to put the x, y for a starting position in a 3x3 matrix for the current window. Then you give the width and height. Therefore, to move the current window to the upper left most block in a 3x3 matric, you would do “hs:setgrid 0, 0, 1, 1”. There is also a hotkey set to this value as an example. hs:command Type in a command string and it will be sent to Hammerspoon directly! There is also an external trigger HammerspoonCommand that will pass whatever is sent in the trigger to Hammerspoon using the command processor as in “hs:command”. This gives other workflows or scripts the ability to interact with Hammerspoon through Alfred. hs:expose This will list all applications. When an application is selected, it will show all of it’s windows in a matrix on the screen and ask the user for the coordinates of the one to show. It will then put all the windows back to their original position and bring the one selected to the foreground. If the application has only one window, it will simply bring it to the front. I also created a hotkey for doing Expose on FoldingText. The user can create more in the same manner. Just be careful to get the name of the application correct! hs:last This command undoes the very last window move. This assumes all window movements were done with Hammerspoon and this workflow functions.","link":"/alfred-hammerspoon/index.html"},{"title":"Haskel Text Converter Workflow","text":"This workflow demonstrates the Haskell Alfred Library. The workflow allows text to be converted to different formats. The following commands are: ht:conv This command takes a string in the Alfred Prompt. You then pick the type of conversion you want. The result is pushed on to the clipboard. ht:start This command starts a dedicated web server for performing the text conversion. ht:stop This command closes the dedicated web server. There is a hotkey for numbering the lines of text in the clipboard. There is also an external trigger for taking text from the clipboard and allowing the user to select a converter. There is a hotkey for triggering that external trigger also that takes the current selection and puts it into the clipboard.","link":"/alfred-haskeltextconv/index.html"},{"title":"Instant Search Workflow","text":"This workflow is the translation of Brett Terpstra’s LaunchBar script for Alfred.

More coming soon…","link":"/alfred-markdownpresentation/index.html"},{"title":"Name Sequencer Workflow","text":"This workflow allows you to sequence through some file names. You set the base name and extension. It will increment the count and place it in the clipboard and Growl it. If there is a file name in the clipboard, you can also just increment the count for the file name. Command Description setname This will set the base name for creating filenames. setext This will set the extension for the filenames created. clearcount This will set the counter back to zero. inccount This will increment the counter by one. deccount This will decrement the counter by one.","link":"/alfred-namesequencer/index.html"},{"title":"Next Item Workflow","text":"This little workflow allows you to sequentially step through items in multiple list files. You use the “Next Item: Set File” file action on the file containing a list of items: One item per line. For example, a list of urls; one per line. Then the hot key will take the next item from the specified first list and copy it to the clipboard and to a notification. If you view all lists before the first list, you will see each corresponding item for each list. The counter is only incremented after passing the item from the first list. Command Description ni:move # This will move the last set file to the # list. If you do not move the file items to a list number, then it will not get sent to you. ni:item This will give the next item from the first list and increment the counter. ni:l # This will give the next item from the # list, but the count will not be incremented unless it is list 1. ni:inc and ni:dec These will increment or decrement the counter. ni:set allows you to set the counter to any number. ni:clear will clear the counter and erase the temporary files. ni:current will display the current count number. The items are addressed using a zero reference. Therefore, if the counter is 1, the the second line in the file will be displayed. Setting a new list will clear the count. The file specified is copied to a work area that all the other scripts will use to access it. Therefore, you do not need to worry about the original file being changed.","link":"/alfred-nextitem/index.html"},{"title":"Notes Workflow","text":"This workflow if for taking notes. It was designed for Calca, but can be used with any editor. So far, I have the following keywords: Command Description n:setnotes This allows for the setting for the location of your notes directory. It is a directory select. Therefore, the directory has to already exist. n:notes This will list every file in the notes directory that ends in “.txt”. You can create a new notes file or open an existing notes file. If you select one of the files while holding the key, you can append the contents of the clipboard to the specified notes file. If that is a new file, it will be started with the clipboard contents. You can move the selected file to the trash by holding the key. This requires the trash command to be in the “/usr/local/bin” directory. You can convert the markdown file to html using the key when you press on a file name. This requires the pandoc program to be loaded onto your system. The key will open the file with Marked.app. n:setEditor This allows you to set the editor that you want to use for editing your notes. It defaults to Calca, but you can set it to any application you want. It will bring up a file selector with applications from your main application folder and your personal applications folder.","link":"/alfred-notes/index.html"},{"title":"NW.js Workflow","text":"NW.js is an application for developing applications using web technologies. You can create an application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using any io.js (formerly node.js) library. There has been a move to this new version due to the node.js project in a stalemate and far behind in development compared to what Chrome is using. Once you have your application developed, you can zip it up with a config.json file. The workflow provides the following commands: Command Description nw:website This opens the NW.js website on GitHub. If you hold down the &lt;cmd&gt; key, it will open the io.js website. nw:open When the user starts typing, a file ending in the “.nw” extension is looked for according to the work typed. Therefore, if there is a file called “new.nw”, as soon as “n” is typed , that file will be displayed. nw:opendir Opens the current directory in Finder or Path Finder using Node Webkit. The config.json file should be in that directory. nw:help Opens this help program. There are also two File Actions defined: Open Directory that is available on directories, and Open NW.js Package that is available on NW.js packages. There are also two External Triggers: RunNWjsDirectory and RunNWjsPackage which work the same as the file actions. These allow external programs or other Alfred workflows to call a Node Webkit application by passing the full path of the application bundle or directory. The help option for this workflow shows an example of using these External Triggers. The following code will open the help application that is located in the same directory as the code: 123thisDir=`pwd`;/usr/bin/osascript -e \"tell application \\\"Alfred 2\\\" to run trigger \\\"RunNWjsDirectory\\\" in workflow \\\"com.customct.NWjs\\\" with argument \\\"$thisDir/help\\\"\" The directory path given in the argument tells NW.js where to load the program.

To use the workflow, you have to have Node.js installed first. I recommend using Homebrew to install it. Once Node.js is installed, go to your Quiver Library file in Alfred Browser and select the “Set Quiver Library” file action. This tells the workflow where your templates (or snippets) are to be kept. Create a workbook called “Snippets” with one note called Defaults. The Defaults note has to have one code block set to JSON and the defaults for the Handlebar expansions set. The rest of the notes will be templates. When you run “qt:expand” or “qt:exptext”, it will list all of your template files in the Snippets notebook. When you select one, it will be expanded with any json cell the note and the Defaults json note data. The “qt:expand” will put the result into your clipboard and the topmost application. The “qt:exptext” will give it to TextExpander to expand and place in the topmost application. With the “qt:exptext” command, TextExpander will also expand any of it’s macros in the template file. I mostly use it for placing the cursor after expansion. These two commands also have an associated Alfred Browser File action. There are four special helper function for Handlebars defined. These functions should be placed inside double or triple brackets. They are: save &lt;name&gt; &lt;text&gt;This command creates a helper named “&lt;name&gt;” with the expanding text of “&lt;text&gt;”. It also places the given “&lt;text&gt;” at the point of definition. This allows you to create text snippets on the fly inside the template. Very handy. clipboardThis helper command places the current clipboard contents at the point in the template. date &lt;format&gt;This will format the current date and time as per the format string given. See the help document that is loaded upon initialization. cdate &lt;date/time&gt; &lt;format&gt;This takes the date/time string and formats it according to the format given.

It should be the format of “s3://{bucket}/directory/..”. It has to be set to “s3://{bucket name}” as the minimum. s3c:target This keyword is used to set a target directory under the base directory to copy individual files to s3 using the file action. s3c:webheader This keyword is used to set a web header for getting a web friendly url to an item in your s3. s3c:sbase This will show the base directory in a notification. s3c:starget This will show the target directory in a notification. s3c:swebheader This will show the header to make a web friendly address in a notification. s3c:copy file This file action will copy the file in the Alfred browser to the base and target directory on s3. s3c:list This keyword action allows you to browse your S3 directory. If you hit “cmd-enter” on an item, it will download it to your Download directory. If you hit “alt-enter” on an item, it will set that directory as your target directory for uploading files. If you hit “ctl-enter” on an item, it will push a web facing friendly url for that item in to the clipboard. If you hit “shift-enter” on an item, it will set the items directory as the base directory for future browsing. If you hit “function-enter” on an item, you can move the item to a new name or location. It will prompt for the new location with a copy of the original item twice. You change the second one. If you start typing after the keyword, your selection will be reduced to selections that match what you type. s3c:configure This keyword will open a terminal and start the configuration process for the s3cmd command line tool.

Then use ss:edit to edit one of the schedules or the template. The unique thing about the workflow is that new schedule’s name will always be something like: 2014-Feb02-Feb08.md. The current year, first day of the week and the last day of the week. The ss:create gives you names for the current week and the next 4 weeks. This works great for me being a missionary.

To use the workflow, you have to have Node.js installed first. I recommend using Homebrew to install it. Once Node.js is installed, go to your snippets directory in Alfred Browser and select the Set Template Directory file action. This tells the workflow where your templates (or snippets) are to be kept. You then run the tp:install to install the example templates and a default global.json file. This file should be edited to match your needs. Any data item added to this file is then passed to the Handlebar render as data. All templates have to have the “.txt” extension. If you want data to be associated with a template, then place a JSON file with the same name as the template in the t When you run tp:expand or tp:exptext, it will list all of your template files in the template directory. When you select one, it will be expanded with any json file with the same name and the global json file data. The tp:expand will put the result into your clipboard and the topmost application. The tp:exptext will give it to TextExpander to expand and place in the topmost application. With the tp:exptext command, TextExpander will also expand any of it’s macros in the template file. I mostly use it for placing the cursor after expansion. These two commands also have an associated Alfred Browser File action. The tp:open command opens the template/snippet directory in Alfred Browser. If you press the Command key, it will open it in the Finder. The tp:editglobal will open the global.json file in your template directory with the default editor for JSON files. The tp:create command requires a name. A file with that name and a “txt” extension is created in the template directory and opened in the default editor for files with a “txt” extension. The tp:createclip command is the same as the tp:create, but this command takes the current clipboard contents as the text for the file. It is then opened in the default editor for “txt” files. The tp:edittemplate command will give a list of templates. When you choose one, it is opened in the default editor for a file with the “txt” extension. The tp:edittemplatedata command will give a list of templates. When you choose one, it’s corresponding JSON file is opened in the default editor for a JSON file. There are two special helper function for Handlebars defined. The helper functions given here are just the names. They have to be inside of two curly brackets to work. This is because I use the same system on my web server to expand macros.

WordPress Script ManagerHave you ever created a new script for adding to your WordPress site by editing the functions.php file or using a plugin like “MaGiKS Proper PHP Include”? It is a great plugin and I used it for several years. It had one problem that kept bugging me. Every time I updated my theme with the automatic updates, I lost my PHP files! I would often forget and have to re-upload the files. Lost scripts are no longer a problem with WordPress Script Manager. WordPress Script Manager keeps all of the scripts in the database for safe keeping. You can update WordPress, themes, and plugins without ever worrying if you forgot to save something. You can work with WordPress PHP, Javascript, SQL tables, CSS, and Less scripts and embed them anywhere in WordPress with a shortcode. You can also show off your code with a code highlighting shortcode. WordPress Script Manager also has a widget for placing your code in any side bar. If you need to tweak a WordPress Filter or Action, you can even create scripts for that. WordPress Script Manager is powerful enough to create full plugins to really get your job done right. Alfred WorkflowsIf you are on a Mac OSX computer, you need to get Alfred. Alfred is Spotlight on steroids and is a great tool for getting a lot of work done. The lastest version is Alfred 2. With this new version, you can create workflows to extend or supplement the things that Alfred can do. It is a very flexible and powerful system. Here is where I am sharing the workflows that I have made. Web API WordPress PluginMany times when a site powered by WordPress wants to supply a Web API for their site, they will work outside of WordPress using either PHP or Ruby on Rails. Then they have to write their own functions to get to the information inside the database for their WordPress site. I always thought that was a little backwards. That is why I wrote the Web API plugin for WordPress.With the Web API plugin, you no longer have to do that. This plugin creates a custom post type called API. When you create an API post, all of the content will be executed as PHP code just before the theme stuff is executed in WordPress. Therefore, you have full access to all the WordPress PHP functions to create whatever you want: JASON output, HTML sniplets, full HTML pages without any of the sites theme or code, or anything else you can imagine. After the code on the page is executed, then the PHP session will be ended. Dropzone DestinationsI really like the new tool: Dropzone! Check out my resourses about this wonderful tool! Textsoap CleanersSince I process a lot of text documents, I really like tools to make that job easier! I found the best one around: Textsoap! Check out what I have about this great tool! Popclip ExtensionsI always love finding new tools. Popclip puts a little, context sensitive menu right at your cursor that you can extend as much as you like. It really is a time saver! Check out what I have written for it. FoldingText ExtensionsFoldingText has become my markdown editor of choice these days. I love coding, so naturally I have created extensions. You can check them out here. I also have an Alfred 2 workflow for FoldingText. Check them out! LaunchBar ActionsLaunchBar 6 is a handy assistant on the Mac similar to Alfred 2. I have been asked to port my Alfred 2 workflows to LaunchBar. Therefore, I have a page listing the actions I have made.","link":"/main/index.html"},{"title":"Favorite Tools","text":"Favorite Software ToolsSince my site is about software tools for your computer, I thought I would share what tools I find useful and fun. Every tool on this page are tools that I use on a regular basis. Some are free, some are not. But, all of them are extremely useful tools. They are not listed in any particular order. I will be adding on to this list, so check by often! I hope you enjoy! By the way, what is your favorite tool? Let everyone know! macOSHere are some of my favorite tools on the Mac. I use these about everyday. fman Everyone needs a great file manager. Fman is the hackers best file manager. In the basic configuration, it is very much like Norton Commander was on Dos systems. But, fman is a full graphics based file manager that is extendable with python. I highly recommand it. fman is also multi-platform program. One license and you can run it on all your system. I currently use it on macOS, Peppermint Linux, and Windows. Not all extensions work on each OS, but many do. You can check my tutorial on writing custom extensions for fman on Tuts+. You can see a list of all my extensions here. Sublime Text 3 This is the best text editor by far! I use it for programming, markdown text creation for the web site, and any small text editing job. It is available on Windows, OSX, and Linux. It is a must have tool! Alfred 3 This great little program saves me many hours of time and keystrokes. It is a program launcher, file system explorer, hotkey runner, text expander, clipboard history manager, itunes controller, … There is no end to how you can use this program to help you use your computer. It is easily expanded using workflows. You can check out some of my workflows! MaxSnap Controling the large number of windows open can sometimes really be hard. I use MaxSnap to make it easier. My favorite feature is the moving and resizing windows with the mouse. Growly Notes This program comes the closest to giving the Mac community the flexibility and utility of Microsoft Office Onenote. I use it to store facts and to organism anything that I write. Being a free program, anyone can use it. But, if you find it useful, please give a donation for the continued development of the program. DEVONthink Pro I just recently started using this powerful program. It would best be called a thought management system for the Mac. It allows the tagging and linking of files or database entries in the program for intelligently managing them. It uses AppleScript for it’s scripting language and give very helpful tools to make the scripts accessable all the time. You can quickly jot notes and throw it into the inbox for filing latter. With the Alfred workflows for it, you can very quickly jot a note to be more fully developed later. It is also an excellent web site bookmarker/archiver. Searching all the content is quick and easy. Dropzone If you do not have Dropzone, I would recommend it. It has many pre-programmed destinations to process files and text. But, if you can not find what you need, you can easily write your own in Ruby! For a person that loves to program, this tool is very fun! Read my tutorial on [Writing Dropzone 3 Actions](http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/writing-dropzone-3-actions--cms-21590) Keyboard Maestro This handy keyboard utility makes writing automation scripts on the Mac very easy. Also, you can expand your clipboards and do all kinds of things. Definitely give it a try! Typinator This great utility program helps speed up your workflow a whole lot. Many of the same things can be done with Alfred, but Alfred does not allow for inputing information in fields of the text clip. Therefore, this program is much more versatile. I actually make use of both for text expanding and love it. DwellClick This nifty little utility will click for you when you stop moving the cursor. It is very handy and help those with problem clicking the mouse a whole lot. RCDefaultApp This free utility for setting default programs to almost any protocal in the Mac OS. Camtasia This is a very good video editing software. I use it for saving frames for the video cover picture and to compress videos. This program works best with mov files. Screenflow This program is similar to Camtasia above, but works best at making mp4 files. Since my job has standardized mostly on mp4, this is my main video editing software. Transmit This is a great S3 upload, download client. CyberDuck This is the same as Transmit, but it is free and on Windows as well. MediaInfo This nice little program will give you all kinds of information about a video. This is very useful to check videos for possible encoder incompatibility. Gimp This is a great, free graphics editing program. I use it all the time to trim down screenshots to the proper size. Auphonics This great program is most useful for increasing the volume of a audio file. It also does a great job cleaning up many unwanted sounds. Audacity This is a great, free program for cleaning up audio files. It has many built-in filters for making the audio sound as good as possible. Name Mangler This is a must have program for renaming files. PopClip This utility program has saved me a lot of hand moving around time. It gives a very handy, programmable popup for copying the current selection (or a lot of other things). Grisbi This is an excellent, personal money management software for Windows, Mac OSx and Linux. ShortCat This utility makes almost everything on the screen keyboard accessable. You definitely need this in your toolbox. Microsoft WindowsHere are some of the tools I use on Windows. Many of the tools I use on macOS is also on Windows. Therefore, I will not repeat those. Microsoft Office This is still the best office suit. Word is a great document writer, Excel is the best overall spreadsheet program, and OneNote is one of the best ideal processors/note taking software around. theWord This is an excellent Bible study software, but it is only on Windows. It runs great in the Mac under Parrallels. Paired with theWord Modules Library, you have access to almost every bit of Christian literature that is in e-format. Phrase Express This great utility program helps speed up your workflow a whole lot. It is also compatable to Text Expander for the Mac. Ditto Ditto is a must have program on Windows. It allows you to manage and control your clipboard. I use it a whole lot! Linux ProgramsI would list the programs I use on Linux, but I would just be repeating myself! Everything has been covered above. There is really nothing that is Linux only that I use.
